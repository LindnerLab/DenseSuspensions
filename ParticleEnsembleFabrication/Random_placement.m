%all units used are in mm, as the stage requires input in mm (and for the
%calculations it doesnt matter).

ChannelW = 5; %Width of the microfluidic channel to be filledin mm
ChannelL = 5; %Length of the microfluidic channel to be filled in mm

Rsmall = 0.05; %Radius of the small particles in mm
Rlarge = 0.75; %Radius of the large particles in mm
